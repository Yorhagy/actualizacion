1.PyCharm is one of the most popular Python IDEs and deservedly so. It’s packed with features such as incredible code completion,
code analysis, code navigation, top-notch Django, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS support, great debugger, and much more.

code intelligence, and it can be extended in Python.

You can install it as a plugin for Eclipse or by installing LiClipse, an advanced Eclipse distribution.

4.Komodo is an IDE for dynamic languages such as Python, PHP and Ruby. Thenew version has many improvements such as code refactoring, multiple selections,
better UI interface, open fast dialog, and much more.

5.Eric is an open-source IDE for Python and Ruby with the ugliest mascot I have ever seen.

6.IEP is an Interactive Editor for Python and not really an IDE. It may be useful for people looking for a Matlab replacement.
It supports multiple Python shells simultaneously and you can program GUI toolkits such as PySide, PyQt4, wx, fltk, GTK, and Tk interactively.

If you are looking for a full-fledged and cross-platform IDE, PyCharm, WingIDE, and PyDev are really your best choices.
